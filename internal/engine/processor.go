// This file serves as the main entry point for the Processor module.
// The implementation has been split into multiple files for better maintainability:
// - processor_core.go: Core Processor struct and initialization
// - processor_block.go: Block processing methods
// - processor_transfer.go: Transfer extraction and handling
// - processor_reorg.go: Reorg handling logic
// - processor_batch.go: Batch processing methods
//
// This allows for better organization and easier maintenance of the codebase.
