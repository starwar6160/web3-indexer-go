// This file serves as the main entry point for the Sequencer module.
// The implementation has been split into multiple files for better maintainability:
// - sequencer_core.go: Core Sequencer struct and main Run loop
// - sequencer_batch.go: Batch processing methods
// - sequencer_process.go: Sequential processing and buffer continuation methods
//
// This allows for better organization and easier maintenance of the codebase.
