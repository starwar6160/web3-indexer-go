// This file serves as the main entry point for the Health module.
// The implementation has been split into multiple files for better maintainability:
// - health_core.go: Core HealthServer struct and main handlers
// - health_handlers.go: HTTP handler methods
// - health_checks.go: Individual health check methods
//
// This allows for better organization and easier maintenance of the codebase.
